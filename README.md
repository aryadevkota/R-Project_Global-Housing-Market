# R-Project_Global-Housing-Market

The global housing market is a current trend of discussion among my generation — with most, including myself, having reserved concerns over the ability to purchase a home. When I think back to this topic, a comparison that has always stood out to me is the exaggeration of being able to purchase a family-home for merely a year’s worth of income. Ultimately, I wanted to explore this claim in more recent years, as well as see how the Affordability Index holds up against fluctuating global factors. I aimed to answer these questions through my visualizations.

The following dataset used for this project, “Global Housing Market Analysis (2015-2024),” is originally from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/ - It is structured as a CSV, covering various economic factors from 2015 to 2024. Ideally, it is meant for real-estate and market-trend analysis; it contains common economic values such as mortgage rates, interest rates, rent and house-price indices, GDP, and more for 20 unique countries.
